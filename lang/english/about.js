  text : `Our story is a story about passion and success. Passion first: there is a common purpose behind our endeavours - to create a welcoming ambience
          and to be a worthy successor to our cultural heritage in which tourism is one of most important things. That leads us to other part -
          our story is story about sucess simply because we are doing quite normal things in an extraordinary manner and with lot of passion.
          And we are proud of our story. We will keep telling it in feature. Only because of you. We have chosen to specialize within the hospitality industry
            and we are aware of that. We are also aware how important is your time and trust. As we aim to become a highly recognised brand respected by guest,
             we know that nothing must not be metter of thing.`
